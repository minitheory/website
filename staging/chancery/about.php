					<h2>Who we are</h2>
					<p>Imagine lawyers who are interested in what you do. Who understand your business language. Who understand the value of the work you create. We will walk with you to maximize your opportunity to realize your goals, finance them or market and sell them. To do that we keep ourselves on the cutting edge. Should the need arise we will defend your rights and protect your assets. We believe in one riot, one ranger. You will not be saddled with more resources than your needs require. We are old school, if need be, we roll up our sleeves and work side by side with you.</p>
					<p>We fight hard and we like to win. But we play by the rules. How we win is important to us. We win the hard way but we win the right way.</p>
					<p>We treasure teamwork. We support our colleagues because they have once supported us in turn. We respect our colleagues professionally, and we also consider it our good fortune that they are our friends.</p>			
					<p>We strive for excellence. While the written word is our stock in trade, it is but a means to an end.</p>
					<p>We are traditional that way, we are Chancery Law.</p>
					<p>Cutting edge lawyers with a traditional handle.</p>
