					<h2>Internships</h2>
					<p>We welcome all applications for attachment and internship throughout the year. We accept applications from law undergraduates as well as pre-university students intending to study law. Our internship will allow you to gain an insight into what goes on in the daily life of a practising lawyer in Singapore and will let you have a better understanding of the legal practice before you embark on your legal career. Interns will get to attend court proceedings, client meetings and are expected to assist in tasks such as legal research, reviewing documents, taking minutes and drafting letters and legal documents.</p>
					<p>If you are keen, send your application to <a href="mailto:info@chanceryllc.com">info@chanceryllc.com</a>. Your application should contain the following information:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Cover letter stating preferred date(s) of internship</li>
						<li>A recent passport-sized photo</li>
						<li>Curriculum vitae including your personal information and contact details</li>
						<li>Copies of "O" and "A" level certificates (or equivalent where applicable)</li>
						<li>Transcripts of all LLB examinations to date</li>
						<li>Awards, prizes and scholarships (if any)</li>
						<li>Extra-curricular activities</li>
