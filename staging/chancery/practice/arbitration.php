					<h2>Arbitration</h2>
					<p>Domestic and international arbitration has changed through the years. With the many arbitral institutional and contract rules governing the conduct of arbitration, this has become a high risk and specialized area of dispute resolution that often involves cross jurisdictional issues.<p>
					<p>At Chancery Law, lawyers have represented companies and individuals in arbitrations governed by the following arbitral regimes: SIAC, SIArb, KLRCA, ICC, LCIA, SIA, ICSID, UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Word Bank Sanctions Board Rules.</p>
					<p>Our lawyers have vast experience in appealing and reviewing arbitral awards before the Singapore Courts; taking out or defending applications for interim measures in support of arbitrations such as injunctions.</p>
					<p>We have also instructed foreign counsel on behalf of clients in relation to the review of arbitration awards in foreign jurisdictions. We have also been engaged by law firms to act as counsel to argue arbitrations in Singapore.</p>
					<p>We have extensive experience in managing and conducting arbitrations both domestically and internationally. We offer a single point of entry for international arbitrations. We are familiar with the following arbitral regimes – Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC), Kuala Lumpur Regional Centre for Arbitration (KLRCA), UNICTRAL Model Law, International Chamber of Commerce International Court of Arbitration (ICC) and International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).</p>
					<p>Our expertise allows us to manage risks at all phases of the arbitral process, including the drafting of arbitration clauses, pre-arbitration negotiations, selection and appointment of arbitrators and qualified technical experts, preparation and collation of evidence, drafting of pleadings, and representation at arbitration hearings and challenge and enforcement of the arbitration awards.</p>
					<p>But in all cases we are mindful that arbitration is but a means to an end. The management of risk and the goals of the client remain paramount.</p>
					<p>Some of our principals accept appointments as arbitrators. Arbitral appointments of our principals are individual appointments not related to the firm’s business.</p>
