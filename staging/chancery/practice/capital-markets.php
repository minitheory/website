					<h2>Capital Markets &amp; Corporate Finance</h2>
					<p>Our experience and expertise include bringing companies to the market via initial public offerings (or reverse takeovers) and leading them through the transition of private to public. We advise investment banks, corporate finance advisory firms and corporate clients on capital raising in the debt and equity markets in Singapore. We assist our clients who are listed on the Singapore Exchange on secondary fund raising exercises such as rights issues, private placements and the issuance of convertible securities. We also advise them on continuing listing requirements as well as matters relating to capitalisation issues, employee share schemes, share buy-backs and de-listings.</p>
					<p>We work closely with the various stakeholders in the corporate finance industry, from the issuer, the shareholders, the strategic investors, the financiers, the corporate finance advisors and consultants to the regulators. Our expertise and our experience allow us to acquire an intimate knowledge, insight and understanding of the perspectives and objectives of these various industry players and we believe we are thereby well-equipped to advise and guide our clients in undertaking and completing a successful capital markets transaction.</p>
