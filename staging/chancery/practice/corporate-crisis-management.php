					<h2>Corporate Crisis Management</h2>
					<p>In our corporate finance practice, we invariably encounter clients who may be involved in allegations of corporate wrongdoing. Sometimes directors are accused of misfeasance of office.</p>
					<p>We counsel companies and directors in terms of corporate regulatory compliance; media releases; statutory announcements and immediate crisis management.</p>
					<p>In crisis management, our approach places prevention at the forefront. We aim to minimise and if possible, prevent reputational damage to a company and its stakeholders. We work with the board of directors to craft strategies and immediate action plans to comply with statutes such as the Companies Act; the Securities and Futures Act and the SGX listing manual and its related codes and regulations.</p>
					<p>We are on call, 24/7, during these critical periods.</p>
