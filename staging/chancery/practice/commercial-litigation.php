					<h2>Commercial Litigation</h2>
					<p>We are experienced court lawyers. More importantly we are comfortable in trying cases. We represent clients at all levels of trial and appellate litigation, as well as in hearings before various specialized and commercial tribunals.</p>
					<p>Our objective in any commercial dispute is to resolve it the way that works best for our client and we will advise clients on whether to avoid, commence, settle, try or mediate a dispute.</p>
					<p>Our strength lies in our ability to understand the issues thoroughly, communicate complex concepts clearly to the client, present the facts persuasively and argue the law effectively. We take technical and procedural objections when it allows a client to side step a full trial.</p>
					<p>We understand our clientsâ€™ needs and will involve our clients in every stage of the process, advising them on all matters relating to the settling of disputes within the context of their entire business.</p>
