					<h2>Alternative Dispute Resolution</h2>
					<p>Singapore, with its reputation for impartiality and integrity and world-class ADR institutions, is increasingly recognized as a preferred venue for ADR in the world.</p>
					<p>We do not see ADR as a challenge to other forms of dispute resolution, rather we see ADR as another avenue for our clients to resolve their disputes.</p>					
					<p>Our lawyers have been involved in complex commercial mediation. We do not approach mediation on the basis of monies that can be saved by not going to a full blown trial. We approach it on the basis that mediation is a viable and substantive means to resolve a dispute.</p>
					<p>Our principals also accept appointments as neutral evaluators. We will give an unbiased opinion on the merits of a case; we will highlight legal and evidential shortcomings of a case and identify areas of dispute.</p>
					<p>Our principals accept appointments as mediators or neutral evaluators. This is a personal appointment unrelated to the Chancery Law. We put in place china walls within the firm, in respect of mediation and neutral evaluation matters.</p>
					<p>All appointments of our principals as mediators and neutral evaluators are accepted on the basis that our firm and its other members will not be deemed to be in a position of conflict in respect of the same dispute.</p>
