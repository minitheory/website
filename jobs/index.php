          <h3>Work-Life Balance</h3>
          <p>We are serious about work-life balance â€“ it's important for doing good work. We don't believe in burning you out with soul-crushing late nights (well, maybe an occasional hackathon and time with our resident Xbox).</p>

          <h3>Learning</h3>
          <p>Learning and self-improvement are a huge part of our culture. We want our team to challenge themselves, learn new skills, try out new things and grow together. Weekly sharing sessions, learning trips are just some methods we adopt.</p>

          <h3>Initiative</h3>
          <p>We believe in helping to grow design in Singapore and the region by contributing to the local startup and design community. Most recently, we co-organised Lean UX Week and spoke at UXSG.</p>
